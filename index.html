				So recently, I signed up for a website, <a href="http://startparttimejob.com">startparttimejob.com</a>, 
				that "pays" for you to get people to click the link, they offered $5 per click. Yea, I know what your 
				thinking. <i>Is that real? Wow, that is quite a bit!</i> This website was "copyrighted" 2017 - 2018. It 
				consists of a cheap UI (User Interface) that probably took approximately five minutes to develop. They 
				try to hide the fact that they are a scam website by setting a $300 minimum payout, not only that, they 
				tell you upfront that it is not a scam and is real.<br/> When you eventually reach $300, they give you 
				a survey you must take to "confirm you are a human." <i>Not that difficult, right?</i> Until you notice 
				that you have no ability to complete them. After every survey you complete, they give you another. 
				Possibly to sell your responses and such. Also, one more thing, they give you a support email! 
				Unfortunately, it's fake, try to email it and you receive a response saying that the email does not 
				exist, or could not be delivered to. I even browsed their functions (Javascript - nerdy stuff) and could not find any function that deals with servers except for a receiving one for the amount you supposedly have.<br/> If this had not been a scam, I'd hold $600 in my pocket.
