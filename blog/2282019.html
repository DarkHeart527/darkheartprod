There are a few that helped lead us to victory during world war ll. Aircrafts are one important technology because, they were used in a large scale for bombing campaigns. The Merlin Engine helped allies hold off the Germans from invading Britain. The biggest factor was machine guns. Machine guns are the biggest because, they change the way wars would be fought. <br/>
Axis fighting on multiple fronts also lead us to victory. The Germans were unable to repel either of the advances on the two fronts and eventually lost the war. Five other nations joined the axis after the start of world war ll.  Allied commander provided unity of purpose & planning & his leadership style encourage flexibility. Allies had developed a number of important strategies in response to German tactics. <br/>
Island Hopping helped big time during this time. Military mainly used this strategy because, allow U.S. forces to reach Japan more quickly and not expend the time, manpower, and supplies to capture every Japanese-held island on the way. Forces only concentrate their resources. It allowed the U.S. to gain control over sufficient islands.It also helped United States to gain military bases and secure the many small islands in the Pacific. <br/>
The Manhattan Project was a very successful because, this once classified photograph features the first atomic bomb. This weapon harnessing the devastating power of nuclear fission. This project helped employed 130,000 Americans at 37 facilities. This also took a very aggressive approach.</div>
