      The US and the USSR both became superpowers in a variety of ways, the US had the Atom Bomb and the USSR given a huge bargaining offer.<br/>

The US created the Atom Bomb, so no other country had it at the time. The Atom Bomb had a blast radius of 0.8 Miles, or 1.3 kilometres. The US was also physically undamaged by the war, having only 416,800 died out of 16 million. The only attack damaging was pearl harbor, when the navy were resting. The US also made very strong allies in the war, it included China, Great Britain, The Soviet Union, and France. The strong allies were Great Britain and The Soviet Union.<br/>

The US was able to make many more allies after the war. They helped out countries with aid of money for rebuilding and such. The countries that provoked the war or had joined in the Axis side, got less money, but were still able to rebuild. Before the war, the US was in a depression, because of the war, the US was pulled out of the depression due to mass war production. <br/>

The USSR was an active participant in in the World Shaping treaties
